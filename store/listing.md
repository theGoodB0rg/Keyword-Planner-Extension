# Keyword Planner Extension

Plan better keywords—right in your browser. Highlight terms on any page to instantly see actionable metrics and build clean, exportable lists without tab-hopping.

## Why it's different

- Export CSV or copy to clipboard
- Optional: sync to your docs workflow (Sheets/Notion)
